    This report introduces the propositional encoding of Bayesian Networks that reduce the Bayesian inference to Weighted Model Counting. The approach encode Bayesian networks into conjunctive normal forms (CNFs) that are associate with weights, and compute the sum of weights of the model that the variables are consistent with the evidence.
     Our work implemented four CNF encoding schemes and tested the performance by feeding the encoded CNFs into the model counter miniC2D, and used runtime and file size for evaluation.\\
