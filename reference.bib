abstract="A modified resolution procedure is described which has been designed to prove theorems about general linear inequalities. This prover uses ``variable elimination'', and a modified form of inequality chaining (in which chaining is allowed only on so called ``shielding terms''), and a decision procedure for proving ground inequality theorems. These techniques and others help to avoid the explicit use of certain axioms, such as the transitivity and interpolation axioms for inequalities, in order to reduce the size of the search space and to speed up proofs. Several examples are given along with results from a computer implementation. In particular this program has proved some difficult theorems such as: The sum of two continuous functions is continuous.",

abstract = "SUMMARY A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of ‘influence’ among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform ‘inference’ by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed ‘marrying’ and ‘filling-in‘. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.",
